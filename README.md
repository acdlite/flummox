Flummox
=======

### 4.0 will likely be the last major release. Use [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux) instead. It's really great.

I know churn can be frustrating but I feel it would be irresponsible for me to continue recommending Flummox when Redux exists and is a significant improvement over classical Flux. Flummox 4.0 will likely be the last major release.

**Check out [redux-actions](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions) and [redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise), which implement much of the convenience of Flummox as Redux extensions.**
