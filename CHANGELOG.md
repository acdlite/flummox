Thanks to [@vesparny](https://github.com/vesparny), [@martintietz](https://github.com/martintietz), [@SimonDegraeve](https://github.com/https://github.com/SimonDegraeve) for your input on new features.

## 2.5.1
- **Bug Fix**
  - `Flux#deserialize()` was passing *entire* state string to stores, instead of the state string for each specific store. Thanks [@martintietz](https://github.com/martintietz) for catching this! [#15](https://github.com/acdlite/flummox/issues/15)
- **Internal**
  - Removed file `arrayIncludes.js`, which was no longer being used.

## 2.5.0

- **New Feature**
  - `Store#register()` now accepts either action ids or actions themselves.
- **Internal**
  - Action ids are stored directly on the action instead of in a separate collection.

## 2.4.0

- **New Feature**
  - Added browser build using webpack, mostly just so we can keep an eye on bundle size.
- **Documentation**
  - Updated README.md
  - Added explanation of enforced unidirectional data flow to Actions.md
  - Added recommended libraries section
- **Internal**
  - Removed dependency on ES6 polyfills to reduce bundle size. Library assumes global Promise.
  - Updated Makefile.

## 2.3.0

This release does introduce a few minor breaking changes... I contemplated bumping the version to 3.0, but the affected areas are such edge cases (undocumented and unsupported ones, at that) that I decided against it. The fact that the project is only, like, a week old was also a factor. In the future, as the API stablizes and matures, I'll try to be better about this.

The semver for this project is a little wacky, since the 1.0 version of this library existed for quite a while, but it was only ever used by me and was quite different in many ways. This is all a long-winded, extra cautious, apologetic way of me explaining why you should use (~) (or exact versions) for dependencies in your `package.json` file instead of the default (^) â€” not just for this package, but for all packages.

- **New Feature**
  - Serialization / Deserialization
  - `Store#replaceState()`
  - Added alias `getConstants()` for `getActionIds()`
  - Better warning messages.
- **Breaking Change**
  - Calling an action only return promises if the original action method returns a promise. Before, all actions returned promises, even if they were synchronous.
  - Instantiating a base Store class will now throw an error. This is technically a "breaking" change, since you used to be able to do so, but it's certainly an edge case. More likely to break tests than actual code.
- **Documentation**
  - API docs
- **Internal**
  - Use spies to test warning messages.
